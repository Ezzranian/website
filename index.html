  <h1><strong>What are Discord Tokens?</strong></h1>
<p>Your Discord token is a produced when you establish an account encryption of your Discord username and password. Your Discord token is an authorization code used to access Discord's servers, and it is made up of a string of numbers and letters. It may be used to log into your account and "authenticates" every activity you do on Discord. Discord uses tokens to keep track of your account and its activity. When you log in to Discord, a token is generated for you and stored on your device. This token is used to authenticate your account and keep track of your activity.
<h1><strong>How do tokens work?</strong></h1>
<p>Tokens are generated by Discord and are used to authenticate your account. When you're logging in from a new device or location, Discord will use your token to verify your identity. Tokens are like digital keys that unlock your account and give you access to all of Discord's features. If someone gains access to your token, they can use it to log in and access your account. That's why it's important to keep your token safe and to never share it with anyone.
<h1><strong>How can I keep my token safe?</strong></h1>
<h2>There are a few things you can do to keep your token safe:</h2>
<p>Never share your token with anyone. Not even Discord's staff can help you if you've shared your token with someone.
<br>
<br>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your account. This will require you to enter a code from your phone or another device whenever you log in. This helps to ensure that even if someone has your password, they won't be able to log in unless they also have your phone or another device.
<br>
<br>Keep your computer and browser up to date. This will help to protect your account from malware and other security threats.
<br>
<br>If you think your account has been compromised, change your password and generate a new token immediately. You can do this by going to your account settings and going to "Password and Authentication", where you will be able to change your password or change 2FA settings.
