  <h1><strong>What is a naval jack?</strong></h1>
<p>A jack is a flag flown from a short jackstaff at the bow (front) of a vessel, while the ensign is flown on the stern (rear). Jacks on bowsprits or foremasts appeared in the 17th century. A country may have different jacks for different purposes, especially when (as in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands) the naval jack is forbidden to other vessels. The United Kingdom has an official civil jack; the Netherlands has several unofficial ones. In some countries, ships of other government institutions may fly the naval jack, e.g. the ships of the United States Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the case of the US jack. Certain organs of the UK's government have their own departmental jacks. Commercial or pleasure craft may fly the flag of an administrative division (state, province, land) or municipality at the bow. Merchant ships may fly a house flag. Yachts may fly a club burgee or officer's flag or the owner's private signal at the bow. Practice may be regulated by law, custom, or personal judgment.
<h1><strong>What is the USNA's naval jack flag history?</strong></h1>
<p>2035 - The United States of North America is established as a union of nations with a shared vision of global cooperation and progress.</p>
<p>2037 - The USNA Navy is established, and a new flag is designed to represent the naval forces of the federation. The flag features a white background with a golden eagle clutching a laurel wreath and arrows in its talons.</p>

<p>2042 - The Naval Jack is introduced as a variant of the USNA Navy flag. It features the same design as the Navy flag, but with a blue background instead of white.</p>

	  <p>2050 - The USNA expands its holdings with the acquisition of several Pacific island nations, leading to a redesign of the Naval Jack. The new flag features the golden eagle and laurel wreath, but with a blue and green background representing the ocean and islands.</p>

<p>2065 - The Naval Jack undergoes another redesign to reflect the growing diversity and inclusivity of the USNA. The new flag features the golden eagle and laurel wreath on a background of interlocking circles in various shades of blue, representing the different nations and cultures that make up the federation.</p>

<p>2080 - As the USNA continues to expand and explore, the Naval Jack is updated once again. The new flag features a golden eagle soaring over a blue and black field representing the vastness of the ocean, with a single star shining brightly in the distance.
</p>
	  <p>2100 - The USNA undergoes a significant redesign of its naval ensign. The new flag is a gironny of twelve, with alternating blue, white, and red triangular sections.
